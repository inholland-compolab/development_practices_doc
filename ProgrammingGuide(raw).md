<h2>Programming with a Graphical User Interface (IDE)</h2>

An IDE (integrated development environment) is an software that provides tools and features for building applications within a single graphical user interface. A selection of IDEâ€™s are recommended depending on your use case and programming language.  



<h2>How to comment</h2>  

A comment within a script explains the purpose of several lines without explicitly stating the obvious. The next developer should be able to continue the work with support of the comments. A comment example is stated (using **//**) below on line 1:  
```c# 
1|  //Hide start menu and spawn inspection mode menu
2|  public void OpenInspectionMode() {
3|      start.SetActive(false);
4|      Instantiate(inspection);
5|  }
```

C++ and C# use **//** (two-slashes) to comment a single line while Python uses **#** (hash sign). In case the comment spans multiple lines (block comments) in a row, both languages use the same comment syntax:  
```c# 
1|  /*Hide start menu and 
2|    spawn inspection mode 
3|    menu*/
4|  public void OpenInspectionMode() {
5|      start.SetActive(false);
6|      Instantiate(inspection);
7|  }
```
 
An **unclear** comment example, states what already is written:  
```C#
1|  //Deactivate start menu and instantiate inspection menu
2|  public void OpenInspectionMode() {
3|      start.SetActive(false);
4|      Instantiate(inspection);
5|  }
```
